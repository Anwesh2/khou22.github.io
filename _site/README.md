# Kevin Hou's Personal Website and Blog
Programmed in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby
Framework: ReactJS

This is the Github repository I use to serve my Github Pages site. This is my main website that I use to centralize my pictures, projects, apps, etc. All my previous websites and social media accounts are linked from this site.

I started building this site in August. I had been writing apps in Java and had done some minor web development before then, but I wanted to start an entire public website from scratch. It lets me not only continue my passion for coding, but also to pursue my interests in design, photography, etc.

If you have any comments, suggestions, or feedback please let me know!
