          Told in terms of “west” and “Africa” — the four zoo animals and the lemurs, respectively — the parallels between this story and the stereotypical African narrative are uncanny.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Westerners become stranded on African land and must learn to adapt in the harsh environment. They find mostly jungles, but finally stumble across a strange group of natives. They do not understand the natives’ foreign way of life and one of them desperately attempts to escape this strange land. The natives see them as “giants,” powerful, God-like entities capable of helping them. The native people, who live in constant fear of an aggressive neighboring tribe, recruit the help of the superior Westerners to fight their tribal war. The natives ultimately benefit and become dependent on the Westerners. The Westerners are now heroes, revered for saving the native people from their barbaric survival.
          <br />
          <br />
          They finally escape the “crazies,” but end up crash-landing somewhere in an African reservation. There, they meet animals similar to them, but that have never been exposed to Western culture. The natives and westerners see each other’s cultures as somewhat strange and have difficulty accepting each other’s practices. The only humans are New York tourists who must survive the harsh African landscape by resorting to barbaric and primitive ways of life. After encountering many stereotypically African groups (the lion tribe, superstitious giraffes, etc.), the Westerners succeed, again, in saving the natives from a drought. They are revered by the natives and finally accepted into the culture.
          <br />
          <br />
          Some of the major themes brought up in the Madagascar series include the “White Man’s Burden,” the Dark Continent, and the idea that Africa is one place filled with primitive natives and suffering.

          <h1>Character Analysis: Lemurs</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="pca-section-text glass-effect">
          The lemurs in the Madagascar series, especially those from the first movie, are analogous to the primitive native because of their resemblance to the stereotypical tribal system in Africa. Not only do they revere and honor the western zoo animals, they also become dependent on them for survival — the major theme in the “White Man’s Burden” narrative.
          <br /><br />
          The lemurs use a traditional, stereotypical tribal structure with an all-powerful king on top and the rest of the people on one level below him. The western zoo animals see the lemurs as crazy and foreign. They become a source of comic relief throughout the series for their eccentricity. They are depicted as weak and Alex even refers to them as “bozos” on one occasion.
          <br /><br />
          King Julian, the leader of the lemurs, brings to light many African stereotypes. Although they are subtle and not intended to ridicule Africa, they subconsciously perpetuate these stereotypes. King Julian believes himself to be in touch with the Gods. In Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, he states that he can speak with the Gods and proposes a sacrificial plan to convince the “water gods” to restore water to the watering hole.
          <br /><br />
          Although it is simply meant to be humorous, it reinforces the negative stereotypes on polytheistic religions. His beliefs are presented as ridiculous, things to be laughed at; however, his beliefs reflect the western conception that Africans all practice polytheistic religions with deities for various elements. Many African cultures do indeed celebrate Gods that harness the power of nature. In this way, Madagascar is specifically poking fun at what is commonly seen as African religion.
          <br /><br />
          This has a huge effect on western audiences, especially kids, who primarily practice monotheism. It will subconsciously reinforce, their minds, that monotheistic religions are more advanced than polytheistic, African religions.
