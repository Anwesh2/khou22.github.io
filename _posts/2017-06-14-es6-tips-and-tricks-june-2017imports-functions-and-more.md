I am writing this blog post because I am, again, using ES6 for my internship. I was first exposed to this variation of Javascript during my very first internship at Salesforce back in Summer 2015. It feels like a long time ago and I've come a _long_ way since then. I am approaching ES6 with new awareness and sharper critical thinking. I felt it was useful to document some of the neat tricks I found with ES6 during my first month of my internship at Moat. A lot of this is partially review â€” a chance for me to shake the rust off and really solidify my skills in ES6.
